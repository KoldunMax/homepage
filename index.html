I hope in future i'll super programmer and i'll help people :) I think, more correcly to say i'll make human's life more easily. For example i can create web services. It's can be a big amount of web services from online surgery school to a service which shows people how to tie their shoelaces. Everything can move to digital format.</p>

                        <p>I passed exams and time is come for choosing Univesity. I stopped my choosing at the KPI. I did that choice because i had heard a lot of good reviews about the University and because the KPI is popular in Ukraine.</p>

                        <p>Studing, Studing else Studing... I was first-year student and i thought that University could give everything for my dream job. But it was mistake. In that period where i first time met programming and my first programming language was C. I even made a few simple games like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and Snake. I passed my first session. It was completely easy, because every free minutes i spent for STUDYING.</p>

                        <p>Here, i changed my meaning about education because i saw that University knowlenge didn't enough for me. I met with C++ and i was reading my first technical book about C++. I made a several projects first project was my University project, it was catalog of military techniques. Where customer could find everything from pistol to a big tank. Honestly say, i didn`t know about DB at that moment and i used notebook like my first DB :-D. Another projects, it was games like tic-tac-toe, hangman and tamagotchi.</p>

                        <p>I interested in studing Photoshop and in that period i first time met C#. That programming language is much easir than C/C++, because i didn`t need worry about dynamical memory, in C# exist special garbage collector for that. I created my first phones shop with using C# (Windows Forms) and it looked funny. My teacher said that my store looked like store for toys because i added a lot of light colors there.</p>

                        <p>From that time, i met my favorite language JavaScript, after C#, C++, C. JS is completely different for me and it turned my attention. I found a lot of information about JS at the metanit, ruseller, codeacademy etc. I wanna say that JS is very popular. His popular has the same lavel with C#, Java or Python and you can use a lot of libraries and frameworks which creates everyday. it's true, Every day somebody creates new framework or library for JS. But i think JS is not easy language because i met a very special moments in JS like typeof null, i think who studies JS they know about that feature but in general JS is actually interesting language which doesn't have boards. In that period i have studied PHP, CSS, HTML and NodeJS, MongoDB yet. I created new catalog but about parkings where customer could find place for his car and i created simple app to-do with using clear JS and with React in the end my last app was chat where customers could echange messages. In future i`ll try to add those projects at the GitHub.</p>
